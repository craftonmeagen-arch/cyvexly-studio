# Cyvexly Next Builder Handoff

## Round 91 closeout

**Session:** scheduled/unattended Claude Code run, 2026-09-07
**Start source:** `cf14cd1` on `main` (pushed, matched `origin/main`)
**Scope:** Checked the Auditor inbox: one new item, `IFA-2026-09-07-R82`
(57th consecutive clean confirmation, "PASS WITH COMMENDATION", evaluated
head `768d84a`, 0 action needed — also independently confirmed the
untracked `velora/` directory is a separate, self-contained sub-project
with its own `.git`/orientation per Owner direction, not Cyvexly
product-source contamination). Moved to `exchange/processed/`. Verified
`tsc`/lint/build clean on unchanged round-87 source. Ran two fresh
convergence checks named by round 90's handoff: (1) About page vs.
`CYVEXLY_VISION_PLAN.md` §6.8's authorized draft/required-content list
and Owner direction's no-founder-identity requirement — **0 defects**,
origin-story paragraph and all five values match word-for-word. (2) A
genuine live in-Browser-pane (not CDP) `Tab`/`Return`/`Space` pass on the
Planner Step 6 `StatusRow` toggle group, untried in-pane since round 7 —
real `Tab` correctly traverses all four buttons per row and into the next
row; real `Return`/`Space` do not activate the focused button, which
re-confirms round 80/81's already-closed tool-artifact finding (not a
regression, not a product defect). **Completion:** DONE WITH PROOF (0
defects found across both checks; 0 source change). Full detail in
`CYVEXLY_APP_DEBT.md`'s "Round 91". Cleaned up: cleared the seeded
Planner `localStorage` draft, closed the Browser pane tab, stopped the
manually-started `next dev` listener on port 5173 by its verified real
listener PID, confirmed port clear; removed the scratch server log.

**No urgent item routed to the next round.** Chunk 5's remaining scope is
entirely Owner-side gates (exact LLC name, Resend account/DNS,
analytics/Search Console ownership or a no-analytics decision, Owner
visual/copy acceptance, final indexability approval) — see
`CYVEXLY_CURRENT_STATE.md` and `CYVEXLY_OWNER_DIRECTION.md`. Next Builder
round: check the Auditor inbox first, apply the round-84 `PATH` fix
before any `pnpm`/`node` command, then pick a fresh surface not yet
covered by rounds 74-91's convergence checks — a good candidate: diff the
Accessibility statement page's specific claims against actual rendered
behavior (contrast, focus order, skip-link, reduced-motion), a surface
named once (round 83) only against `site-config.ts` arrays, not against
live rendered behavior.
