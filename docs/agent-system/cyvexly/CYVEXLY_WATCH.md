# Cyvexly Watch Index

Observations and evidence, not new rules. Each entry is a place to look, not a
boundary on future reasoning.

## Round 1

- **`Claim-BuilderLock.ps1` failed to parse on this machine before any fix.**
  The file (authored during environment setup) contained a real em-dash inside
  a string literal with no UTF-8 BOM. Both `powershell.exe` and the `pwsh`
  7.6.5 host in this sandbox parsed it as a different encoding, producing a
  `MissingEndParenthesisInMethodCall` error on every invocation — this was a
  guaranteed 100%-reproducible tooling failure, not lock contention. Adding a
  UTF-8 BOM to the file fixed it without changing its literal output text.
  Worth checking whether the other setup-authored `.ps1` files or any
  future-authored project file with non-ASCII characters (em-dashes, curly
  quotes) hits the same class of problem — `grep -rlP '[\x80-\xFF]'
  .codex/roles/scripts/*.ps1` is a fast way to check.
- **Next.js 16's `next dev` writes an agent-rules block into the project's
  `AGENTS.md` by default**, which collided with this sandbox's Owner-authored
  `AGENTS.md`. Confirmed and fixed with `agentRules: false` in
  `next.config.ts` (see `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/
  generate-agent-files.js` for the mechanism if it needs re-verifying after a
  Next.js upgrade).
- **A live Auditor round was running concurrently** during this Builder round
  (`.codex/runtime/auditor/auditor-20260830T1324Z-001/`, guard file
  `.codex/role-state/auditor.active.json` created ~13:24 UTC, a few minutes
  after this Builder's lock claim at ~13:19 UTC). This Builder did not
  inspect, stop, or otherwise touch that Auditor's resources — only excluded
  its disposable runtime path from this project's own ESLint scope
  (`.codex/**` in `eslint.config.mjs`), which is a Builder-owned config file,
  not Auditor infrastructure. Concurrent Builder/Auditor rounds are expected
  and allowed by the governing packet (§7.10); noting it here only because it
  was unexpected to observe mid-round with no coordinating Owner message
  found in this round's reading.
- **This scheduled/unattended Builder session cannot produce browser
  screenshots.** `preview_start` with a `name` config refuses to launch a dev
  server ("Dev servers can't be started from unattended sessions"), and even
  after starting the dev server manually via a shell command and attaching
  the Browser pane with `preview_start({url})`, `computer` screenshot/click
  actions fail because "the Browser pane is not displayed, so the page is not
  compositing frames." DOM/content/console/network inspection and JS-driven
  interaction checks all worked fine in this same unattended session. See
  `CYVEXLY_CHUNK_DEBT.md` item 1.
